#How to Use
Users sign in to Snippet using Facebook or Instagram.  When they reach the main page, they will be able to use the search bar on the front page to query  Facebook and Instagram for their pictures.  
When the users enter the main page, picture cards will fill the main page.  Users can interact with the display in many ways.  They can use the main buttons on the top of the page to change how the cards are visualized, click on the cards to view extra data associated with each picture or remove cards to customize their snip.  Users can also remove cards, and save the collection they have as a new snip.
